<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

-Introduction-

### Product Vision

<p>With growing opportunities of derivating and customizing financial products the product range of financial institutions is emerging rapidly. Hence, the difficulty of good consulting is rising equally while high complexity products drive the largest costs which are outgrowing benefits and revenue of conventional consulting. <br>
The Financial Product Portfolio Quick-Check simplifies financial consulting by providing an information-rich project-related overview of financial products. 
This overview helps our consultants understand the risks and opportunities of different financial products, while it tries to maximize profits by identifying overly complex products, which do not contribute to the business volume. <br>
Additionally, the product provides useful visualisations annotated with source documents to ensure an increase of a consultants efficiency in assessing the benefit of a product.<br>
Published under the <a href="#license">MIT license</a>, the aim is to make it accessible for our business partner as well as for any other organization and enable an enormous amount of other use cases. </p>

### Project Mission

<p> Our project mission is to provide a web application which allows structured data entry for financial products, comparison and evaluation among products and product variants as well as with source documents annotated visualization. <br>
The core feature of the software is a calculation of benchmarks regarding complexity combined with annotated result charts.
To meet the objectives mentioned above, we will maintain a helpful and friendly team atmosphere. </p>
